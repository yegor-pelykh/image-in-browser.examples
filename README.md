Overview
========

This project contains a set of examples of using library  [**image-in-browser**](https://github.com/yegor-pelykh/image-in-browser).

All tests are located in the [**examples**](https://github.com/yegor-pelykh/image-in-browser.examples/tree/main/examples) folder.

Files with examples are divided into sections according to the subject of the example.

Each example is a separate Typescript file and is independent from other examples.

> **_NOTE:_**  There is also a `_utils` folder. Unlike other folders, it doesn't contain examples, but stores some helpers and commonly used functions that are used as syntactic sugar in the examples.

How to run and debug?
=====================

To run the examples, it is most convenient to use the VSCode IDE, for which the corresponding launch scripts have already been prepared.

To run the example:
- open the file with the example you want to run or debug
- press F5 in VSCode

The environment will launch the build process in the background, and then launch the currently open example for execution and debugging.
